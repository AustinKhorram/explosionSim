### Project Description

Apart from military applications, various engineered products rely on explosions, or their ability to withstand them, in order to function. The most obvious example is the internal combustion engine, where thousands of controlled explosions happen every minute. Here, knowledge of the force on the seals and piston, as well as the propagation of the shock waves and changes in temperature, is extremely important for design. Even a rocket can be modelled as a controlled explosion.

We intend to model explosions and how they propagate using Lagrangian mechanics, as well as computational fluid dynamics. Using the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, we will employ point particle simulations to predict the trajectory of particles after detonation. We also will investigate how these explosions affect the motion of free objects.

### How to Use the Three.js model

Implementations are added into index.html. The /js  folder contains models and etc. To start the sim, just open sim.html in a web browser (preferably chrome). All functions should be developed in main.js or other javascript files. Developer Tools in Chrome is great tool for debugging.
